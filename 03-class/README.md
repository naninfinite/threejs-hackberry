ran into canvas initialisation error. i didn't put 'canvas.webgl' query selector into quotes.
after fixing that created stack trace error. the material shader was undefined because i used .Material instead of .MeshBasicMaterial.
simple fixes just need to be sharper

first three.js build using hackberry
